				<p><font size=70><b>W</b></font>hen Governor Charlie Baker joined nearly 30 other politicians in refusing to
				allow Syrian refugees into his state following the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, Katelyn
				O'Leary saw the effects of his words firsthand.</p>

				<p>The 24-year-old currently teaches English exclusively to refugees and immigrants
				in Worcester, Mass. While her students are usually from South America, more and
				more students from Syria have trickled into her classroom, as the civil war in
				the region has produced the worst refugee crisis in recent history. In the midst
				of anti-refugee sentiments developing across the United States, one student, a
				Syrian boy, has become the target of bullying.</p>

				<p>"He's having a hard time, especially right now with everything that's going on,"
				O'Leary said, "And the other kids definitely know what to say to piss him off."</p>

				<p>O'Leary is one of the few teachers in Massachusetts who has been assigned with
				educating the Syrian refugees coming into the state. Despite Baker's opposition,
				around 70 Syrian refugees have already been resettled in Massachusetts,
				according to the Office of Refugees and Immigrants in Massachusetts.</p>








				<p>Worcester, the third largest district in Massachusetts, has become the state's
				leading destination for refugees. Anita Fabos, an associate professor of
				international development and social change at Clark University, explained that
				Worcester has a long history of resettling refugees, long before refugee resettlement
				was an official process in the 80s. "If you look at the population of Worcester now,
				you see a strong Armenian presence...as well as Albanian, Vietnamese, and Lebanese."</p>

				<p>According to a 2015 study funded by Clark University's Mosakowski Institute
				for Public Enterprise, the city has resettled more than 2,000 refugees from
				around 25 countries in the last 5 years. Currently, Worcester has taken in more
				Syrian refugees than Boston.</p>

				<p>Fabos, a leading researcher for that study, explained that there are specifics
				about Massachusetts that makes Worcester a particularly appealing city for refugee
				resettlement.</p>

				<p><font size=70><b>F</b></font>abos said, "In the case of refugees who don't speak English, Worcester has some quite
				good employers who are willing to take folks without English language skills,
				like Federal Express and Wal-Mart...this is appealing for agencies
				who have a federal mandate to get refugees working within a month."</p>

				<p>Fabos also noted the exorbitant housing prices in Boston as another reason
				why many Syrian refugees were being placed with Worcester agencies rather than
				Boston ones.</p>

				<p>The Syrian refugees resettled throughout Massachusetts pose several questions
				to the state, most importantly how to educate them. The New Citizens Center (NCC)
				school in Worcester, which specifically educates children from immigrant and refugee
				backgrounds with gaps in their education, is one possible answer. Stephen Alzamora,
				the principal of NCC, says that addressing students' trauma is a key issue because
				100% of his students are coming from traumatic situations.</p>

				<p>"We find out over time what can trigger kids…if we are watching a film in a
				class and we turn off the lights, that might trigger a kid," says Alzamora, "Or
				if we have a student seated too close to a male, that may trigger a kid. We
				address these issues and try to help them work past the trauma."</p>

				<p>The school also has an "open-door" policy in one of the main offices, according
				to Alzamora. If a student is feeling too overwhelmed in class, they have a free
				pass to leave the class and come into the office in order to take a break.</p>

				<p>"Because what we're asking from these kids is to sit in school for 6 hours a day,
				  45-minute class sessions...it's a lot to expect. When they come down to the office, they
				  can help out the custodian or do some task, just something to give them a break from
				  sitting and writing all day."</p>

				<p>Michael Hargrove, an English-as-a-Second-Language teacher in Doherty Memorial
				  High School in Worcester, distinguishes the lack of Arabic-speaking teachers in
				   Worcester as one of the major difficulties in educating Syrian refugee students.</p>

				<p>"It's not like Spanish, where six of us know Spanish," says Hargrove, "It's
				  amazing. Because what happens when you have someone dumped in your lap? I know
				  sixteen words and phrases in Arabic...it's nothing."</p>

				<p>"Theoretically, we can call downtown for a translator. But they are a separate
				  contracted entity that we pay hourly."</p>

</div> <div class="cd-fixed-bg cd-bg-6"> </div> <div class="cd-scrolling-bg">
				<p><font size=70><b>A</b></font>lzamora agreed that the lack of Arabic-speaking teachers in the district was
				  a challenge. "If we have an Arabic speaking student who is sick and we have to
				  call home and ask that parent to come pick them up, that's a real challenge for
				   us."</p>

				<p>Alzamora said when situations like this occurred the school frequently turned
				  to teaching aides who can speak Arabic or the surrounding agencies that can
				  provide a translator.</p>

				<p>All the teachers interviewed agreed that the anti-refugee sentiment in the
				  United States often interferes with Syrian students' progress. Elizabeth Denver
				   Ward, a nurse practitioner at Sullivan Middle School in Worcester, says that
				   one Syrian refugee student in the school frequently came to her office to talk
				    during breaks, as politicians were discussing banning Syrian refugees from
				    the country in the news.</p>

				<p>"It's a lot of 'what does this mean', 'no one is really talking about it at
				  home, but I'm hearing about it.' I had to reassure her that not everyone wants
				  to ban her or her family. That was one of the hardest things I've had to do in
				   my career: reassure people that they're wanted."</p>

				<p>Fabos commended the teachers in Massachusetts for how they have dealt with the
				  influx of Syrian refugee students, saying "I have observed incredibly good intentions."</p>

				<p><font size=70><b>S</b></font>he also said that the NCC school in Worcester has provided a solution for
				  Syrian refugee students, who have struggled to have their children enrolled
				   into schools in Jordan or Lebanon. "This is a place that really understands
				   that sometimes kids come from disrupted educational backgrounds. It's not
				   that they are forbidden from going to schools [in Lebanon or Jordan] but
				   the parents have to come up with school fees and the schools are crowded."</p>

				<p>For now, though, one of the biggest challenges facing Syrian refugees now
				  resettled will be beginning to feel at home in their new countries.</p>



				<p>"I think that [Charlie Baker's] words probably felt like a smack in the face,"
				  Fabos said, "[What he said] is not borne out of any of the facts, any of the
				  systemic mechanisms for resettling refugees. If it were a policy, it is the wrong
				   policy to encourage belonging and social cohesion. It has the opposite effect."</p>

<p>Moreover, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently visited Worcester for a campaign rally, in November 2015.
	At the rally, Trump turned his attention specifically to Syrian refugees, saying "this could be the great Trojan horse of all time.
	Trump went on to win 49 out of 50 precincts in Worcester during the Republican primaries.</p></div>

				<p><font size=70><b>O</b></font>'Leary, still thinking of her bullied Syrian student, mentioned how she recently
				  started an immigration unit in class to try to counter anti-refugee sentiment in
				  the classroom. "I asked them to bring in a tradition from home. They first talked
				  about Thanksgiving or Christmas, but I said, 'No, I want one from Pakistan, I
				  want one from El Salvador'."</p>

				<p>Because her students were still reluctant to share, O'Leary talked to her students about her own Irish traditions. "They didn't understand that the Irish went through the same thing. So, I told them about the Potato Famine, and about 'Irish need not apply', and having their names changed at the door."
				O'Leary described her students' reactions as shocked.</p>

				<p>"Now, they're telling me about Ramadan, about Eid, about things they're now comfortable to tell me about."</p>
