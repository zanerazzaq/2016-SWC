<br>Even though president elect Donald Trump has vowed to ban Syrian refugees</br>
<br>from entering the country, Massachusetts has quietly been resettling dozens</br>
<br> of refugees within the state. Thanks to data from the Bureau of Population,</br>
<br>Refugees, and Migration Office of Admissions, we can see that Syrian refugees </br>
<br> are mainly being resettled in the poorer cities in Massachusetts, like Lowell</br>
<br> where there are 30 Syrians, or Springfield, where there are 38.</br>
